# Openplanet Chaos Collab Plugin

This plugin is a challenge for the Openplanet developer community to create a plugin where everyone can add one line at a time.

### Add your code
To add your code to the plugin, fork this repository and add **one line** to the plugin script `ChaosCollab.as`. Open a merge request to this repository to submit your change, merge requests will get automatically approved for valid submissions and your code will be integrated in the plugin!

> NOTE: The automated workflow will NOT run if any file other than `ChaosCollab.as` is modified.

### Challenge rules
- Only add **1 new line** to the plugin. It doesn't have to be at the end of the file.
- New lines have a maximum length of 200 characters.
- Existing lines cannot be modified or deleted.
- You cannot submit a new change if you were the last person to make a submission. You should wait until another person continues the chain.
- Please try and keep the code readable for others. This is not code golf, it's just a fun challenge.

Submissions which break the rules will get reverted, check all these rules yourself (for example by doing a `git diff`) to make sure no problem will occur.

### What should the plugin do?
No idea, you can make it whatever you want it to be. But remember to follow the rules.

### License
By contributing to this repostiory, you agree to license your changes under the MIT license.
